First Principles

1. Form - it is just not win/loss. Consider:
Who they played (level)
Recent, YTD, Overall
Expectancy (betting)
Reasons (Contingencies - injuries etc)
Patterns (time of year/tournaments)

2. Fitness - gauge level of well being
Look for bandaging
Body language
Recent withdrawals/retirements
Time since last played
Movement

3. Motivation
Big tournaments are no brainers, others?
Do they want it (next tournament)
Prize-money
Points available
Opposition
Past efforts

4. Head to heads
Match-ups can be revealing
Recent (more relevance)
Surface
Expectancy
Changes since (improvements)

5. Proximity - think it through
When they last played
Players profile revealing
Recovery/prep time
Planned schedule (what next)

6. Surface/Conditions - watch for changes during the day/tournament
Players profile (win/loss) on various surfaces
Parallels (indoor/clay suits base-liners)
How the court is playing
Time of day
Weather (humidity/heat/wind)

7. Rank - is relative. Factor related
Career-high rank
Current rank
Surface rank
Make own ranking
Potential

8. Location
Journey (trip)
Time zone (jet lag)
Support (local fans?)
Preparation time
Regional weather forecast

9. Tournament History - history often repeats itself.
Past performance
Changes in date/surface
Prize money/ranking (then/now)
Competition
Expectancy (then/now)

10. Stage of Tournament - no two players are the same.
What is typical
Quick starter (well prepared)
Grow into tournaments
Consistency
Erratic results


10 further considerations
Type of opponent
Slow/quick starters (beneficial for in-play)
Match length (assess handicap - some make heavy of winning)
Reliability (predictability isnâ€™t always good for betting)
Watch for changes (night/cover plays slower)
Right bookmaker accounts (higher odds = higher ROI)
Use pinnacle opening/pre-match lines
Bet the odds, not the player (everything as a price - put into chance%)
You can only control what you can control
Attend tournaments (see/learn a lot)
